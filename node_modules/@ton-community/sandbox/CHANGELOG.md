# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2023-02-09

### Changed

- Treasuries obtained by `blockchain.treasury` calls are now initialized during this call and will no longer produce an extra transaction when first sending a message
- Transaction processing loop now prefetches contracts, which should provide a performance boost in some scenarios

## [0.3.0] - 2023-02-05

### Changed

- `Blockchain` and `SmartContract` now use `LogsVerbosity` (see below for definition) as the verbosity type, which allows for more control over what kinds of logs are printed. Logs from TVM debug primitives are now enabled by default, again. (You can disable them globally by setting verbosity with `debugLogs: false` on the `Blockchain` instance)

Definition of `LogsVerbosity`:
```typescript
type LogsVerbosity = {
    blockchainLogs: boolean
    vmLogs: Verbosity
    debugLogs: boolean
}
```

## [0.2.2] - 2023-02-03

### Added 

- Added `blockchain.runGetMethod(address, method, stack)` to run a get method on the specified address
- Added `blockchain.setShardAccount(address, account)` to directly set the state of smart contracts
- Added `account: ShardAccount` getter and setter to `SmartContract`
- Exported helper methods `createEmptyShardAccount`, `createShardAccount` for use with `blockchain.setShardAccount` and `smartContract.account` setter
- Added the ability to pass `Cell`s into `blockchain.sendMessage`

### Changed

- Removed unnecessary `async` modifiers from `smartContract.receiveMessage` and `smartContract.get`
- Logs from TVM debug primitives (for example, `DUMP` and `STRDUMP` with corresponding FunC functions `~dump()` and `~strdump()`) now respect the `verbosity` parameter and will only work when it is not `none`
- Logs from TVM debug primitives are now printed using a single `console.log` call per one TVM execution to avoid cluttering the terminal during unit tests

### Fixed

- Fixed potential race conditions between execution of different transaction chains on the same `Blockchain` instance by use of an `AsyncLock`

### Removed

- Changed `blockchain.pushMessage`, `blockchain.processQueue`, `blockchain.runQueue` to be private
