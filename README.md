# Example how to write FunC contracts with ton/sandbox

## Before use
- Install dependencies (FunC, Fift etc) library for help https://ton.org/docs/develop/smart-contracts/sdk/javascript
- Or install from sources https://ton.org/docs/develop/smart-contracts/environment/installation
## How to use
- **npm run build** -- building your contract from contracts/ folder and putting it into build/ compiled artifacts
- **npm run test** -- running tests from tests/ folder

## Profit
You can use one repository for writing (on FunC) and testing (Typescript) your contracts.
